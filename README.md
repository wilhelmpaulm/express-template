# express-template

-   created this template so I don't have to remember what to install when I build APIs.
-   this contains logging, http security, cors, parsers, babel, etc. out of the box.
-   think less about the things you build with and more about actually building

# logs

-   once you start the server, log files would be located at `logs`
-   this auto updates daily

# commands

-   `npm run dev` for starting the dev server
-   `npm run build` for packaging your app
-   `npm run test:e2e` for running your tests in `/tests`
